# hello-world
The GitHub tut folder


Hello! Trying to get to grips with GitHub for version control and collaborative working... It's been a while for me, in fact the guy in the office with a 512Mb USB flash drive was fancy and collaborative working was sending an email telling your where to find a file on the Dev server! Best get up to speed if I ever want to have a job again.

TTFNMF!
